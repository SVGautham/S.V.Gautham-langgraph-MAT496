## Module 1
**Video 1 â€“ Motivation:**
The video talks about how traditional language model workflows, known as chains, work well but can be too limited. LangGraph was developed to make these workflows more flexible. It lets developers set up the dependable parts of a process while allowing the LLM to make decisions on its own when necessary. This makes it easier to build AI agents that are smarter and can adapt to different situations.
